# Experiments with the hyperparameters

The aim fo this project was to understand the effect of each hyperparameter in the classification accuracy of a model. 
Each subsequent model used the value of the best performing hyperparameter from the previous. 
Aiming to constantly create a better model with better classification accuracy.

- Analysis of the MNIST dataset
- Implementation of 5 DL models with FeedForward
- Accuracies of range 92-99%
